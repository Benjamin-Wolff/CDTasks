CDTask2 - Created by Benjamin Wolff

This task is my python implementation of the cd command in unix. Along with the source code, which uses a list to
function as a both a stack and a list when convenient, is a test file which uses various unittest tests and a set of
sample directories (ab, cd, ef, gh, ij) similar to the ones used in the java implementation for testing the code.

This project contains:
    - MyCD python file with main function to run operations
    - CDTests2 python file with various unit tests
    - sample directories for test/practice
    - this README.txt file

To run the code in the command line:
    - move the MyCD.py file where convenient or enter the CDTask2 directory from the command line
    - run the MyCD file with python, followed by the starting and ending directories

SAMPLE COMMAND LINE INPUT (from within the CDTask2 directory):
    #python MyCD.py ./ab ./cd/.../gh/ij/
OUTPUT FROM SAMPLE:
    ./gh/ij/
